"""Notify active admins about leave-society events (request submitted, member
finalized) via in-app notification, SMS, Telegram, and email. See ~/auth-service's
/api/sms/send and /api/telegram/send for the SMS/Telegram delivery transport;
email is sent directly via app.email's Gmail SMTP.

Split in two so the outbound HTTP/SMTP fan-out never happens while a pooled DB
connection is held open:
  - notify_admins() runs inside the caller's existing
    `async with pool.acquire() as conn:` block — it records the in-app
    notification row for every active admin and returns their phone/email.
  - send_channels() runs after that block exits, via BackgroundTasks, since
    auth-service's SMS failover chain (and SMTP) can take several seconds
    worst case and must not sit on the resident's request/response cycle.
