"""Broadcast an event-details change to every active account, including the
organizer who made the edit — everyone should get a copy confirming what
changed. Distinct from require_event_access()'s narrow organizer/permission-
grantee circle — an edited *published* event (date, venue, price, etc.
changed) is public-facing information residents may have already acted on.

Split in two for the same reason as the other services' notification modules
(registration-service, payment-service): resolve_and_record() runs inside the
caller's pooled DB connection, send_channels() fans out SMS/Telegram/email
afterward via BackgroundTasks so the outbound HTTP/SMTP calls never hold the
connection open.
