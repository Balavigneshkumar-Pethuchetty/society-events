"""Notify whoever manages an event (organizer + active event_permission
grantees) via in-app notification, SMS, Telegram, and email — used when a
resident submits a payment-verification screenshot, cancels a booking, or
that cancellation triggers a refund request. See ~/auth-service's
/api/sms/send and /api/telegram/send for the SMS/Telegram delivery
transport; email is sent directly via app.email's Gmail SMTP.

notify_refund_processed() / notify_payment_verdict() are the resident-facing
counterparts: they resolve the single resident who owns a
payment_transaction (rather than the event's organizer/permission
grantees) and notify them once their refund has been paid out, or once
their checkout screenshot has been reviewed (verified/rejected).

Split in two so the outbound HTTP/SMTP fan-out never happens while a pooled
DB connection is held open (max_size=10 — see database.py):
  - resolve_and_record() / notify_refund_processed() / notify_payment_verdict()
    run inside the caller's existing `async with pool.acquire() as conn:` block.
  - send_channels() runs after that block exits, via BackgroundTasks, since
    auth-service's SMS failover chain (and SMTP) can take several seconds
    worst case and must not sit on the resident's request/response cycle.
